# ML-Supervised-Learning

## Introduction
This is a practice repo on Classification (Data Mining). **Classification** is a form of data analysis that extracts models describing important data classes. Such models are called **Classifiers** which predicts categorical(unordered, discrete) class labels. Data Classification consist of two steps:
* Learning step
* Classification step

Theoretical concept of classifiers and techniques(**machine learning models**) to learn different classifiers are discussed in this repo.
